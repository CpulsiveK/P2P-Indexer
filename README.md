# P2P-Indexer
This repository contains the server side code for the Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Sharing Application repo

# Start the indexer
To run the code simply go to the commandline and cd into the directory containing the indexer.py file and run this command: 'python indexer.py' or simply run python 'path/to/file.py'
NB: python 3 or higher required

There will be an output of the ip address the indexer is bound to and messages that reads 'Listening for incoming connections' and '[BROADCASTIN] {server ip}......'. This means the indexer is running.
