# P2P-Indexer
This repository contains the server side code for the Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Sharing Application repo

# Start the indexer
To run the code simply go to the commandline and cd into the directory containing the main.py file and run this command: 'python main.py'
NB: python 3 or higher required

There will be an output of the ip address the indexer is bound to and a message that reads 'Listening for incoming connections'. This means the indexer is running.
